## Project dataset overview
By integrating UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) mobility data with World Bank GDP indicators, we explore the relationship between a country's economic status and its role in international education exchanges. The data principles of the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) and the World Bank emphasize openness, quality, accessibility, interoperability, and transparency, ensuring that data is freely available, methodologically sound, standardized across countries, and clearly documented to support informed decision-making and accountability.
